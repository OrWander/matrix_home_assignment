Hi There!

As requested, I've created a shopping application, where users are able to search their favorite smartphone brand, and see it's current price and appearance!

The layout is according to the requirments:
* 2 rectangles, one above the other, both are meant to search a smartphone. The upper one is for searching by smartphone name, and the lower one is for seeking according to one of three categories - from the lower price to the highest, the opposite, and lastly, the most popular smartphones (sorted by the "rating" key).
* Smartphone display - beneath the 2 search components. Please notice that the number of products in one line is changing according to different screen sizes, so in thiner screens - it will show less then 4 smartphones/products. 
If needed I can make changes, easily. 

In case something went wrong, please follow the next steps:
1. click on "Products" tab, in the header/upper navbar. 
2. Open the console --> than on Network tab, to make sure http request is being send to the API. 

To be continue - Reusable modal component and more. 


I hope you'll enjoy!
